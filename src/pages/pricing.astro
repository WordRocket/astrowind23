    items={[
      {
        title: 'What does "bring your own API" mean?',
        description: 'WordRocket connects to your OpenRouter API account, which gives you access to multiple AI models like GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini. You pay OpenRouter directly for AI usage, and WordRocket provides the interface and templates. This gives you more control and often better pricing than traditional SaaS models.',
      },
      {
        title: 'How much does API usage typically cost?',
        description: 'API costs vary by model and usage. For example, generating a 1,500-word blog post with GPT-4 typically costs $0.10-0.30. Claude 3.7 Sonnet is often cheaper at $0.05-0.15 per article. You have full control over which models to use based on your budget and quality needs.',
      },
      {
        title: 'What happens after the beta period?',
        description: 'We\'ll announce pricing before the beta ends. Beta users will get special pricing and grandfathered benefits. Our goal is to keep WordRocket affordable while providing exceptional value. You\'ll have plenty of notice before any changes.',
      },
      {
        title: 'Can I use free AI models?',
        description: 'Yes! WordRocket includes access to free AI models for basic content generation. You can create SEO-optimized blog posts without any API costs. Premium models like GPT-4 require your own API key but offer higher quality results.',
      },
      {
        title: 'Is there a limit on content generation?',
        description: 'During beta, there are no limits on WordRocket\'s side. Your only limit is your API budget with OpenRouter. For free models, you can generate unlimited content. This gives you complete control over your content production costs.',
      },
      {
        title: 'Do you offer refunds?',
        description: 'Since WordRocket is currently free during beta, refunds don\'t apply. Once we launch paid plans, we\'ll offer a satisfaction guarantee. Your API costs with OpenRouter are separate and managed by their refund policy.',
